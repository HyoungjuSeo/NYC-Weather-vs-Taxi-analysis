## Release Procedure

- Ensure all tests pass.

- Update version number in `conda.recipy/meta.yml`, `datashader/__init__.py`,
  and `setup.py`. Commit.

- Tag commit and push to github

    git tag -a x.x.x -m 'Version x.x.x'
    git push upstream master --tags

- Build conda packages

The exact procedure is platform/setup specific, so I'll define a few variables
here, to fill in with your specifics:

    # Location of your conda install. For me it's `~/anaconda/`
    CONDA_DIR
    # Platform code. For me it's `osx-64`
    PLATFORM
    # Version number of datashader being released (e.g. 0.2.0)
    VERSION

This assumes `conda`, `conda-build`, and `anaconda-client` are installed (if
not, install `conda`, then use `conda` to install the others). From inside the
toplevel directory:

    conda build conda.recipe/ --python 2.7 --python 3.4 --python 3.5

Next, `cd` into the folder where the builds end up.

    cd $CONDA_DIR/conda-bld/$PLATFORM

Use `conda convert` to convert over the missing platforms (skipping the one for
the platform you're currently on):

    conda convert --platform osx-64 datashader-$VERSION*.tar.bz2 -o ../
    conda convert --platform linux-64 datashader-$VERSION*.tar.bz2 -o ../
    conda convert --platform win-64 datashader-$VERSION*.tar.bz2 -o ../

Use `anaconda upload` to upload the build to the `bokeh` channel. This requires
you to be setup on `anaconda.org`, and have the proper credentials to push to
the bokeh channel.

    anaconda login
    anaconda upload $CONDA_DIR/conda-bld/*/datashader-$VERSION*.tar.bz2 -u bokeh

- Write the release notes:

 1. Run `git log` to get a listing of all the changes
 2. Remove any covered in the previous release
 3. Summarize the rest to focus on user-visible changes and major new features
 4. Paste the notes into github, under *n* `releases`, then `Tags`, then `Edit release notes`.
